12ToneHelper
============

A small application to help with 12 tone composition.

It is really simple, just generates the grid and then allows you to advance arrows across it to keep track of where you are in each row at any given time.  To advance the arrows press the button at the start of the row you want to go across.

The program builds against Qt4 or Qt5 and has no other dependancies.  It has been built under Windows 7 and Arch linux, but should build everywhere else as well.

To build simply type "qmake" followed by "make" or load up the .pro in QtCreator.
